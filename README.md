# PastaBox
You wake up on a Sunday morning with an idea in mind. You brainstorm it under the shower, and then you transform this idea into code, ultimately crafting it into a cute application!

That's the story behind this project.

It's not particularly innovative â€” it's essentially a snippet manager. However, it was a perfect opportunity for me to experiment with some exciting stuff:

* Exploring the fantastic Fluent UX library by [WPF-UI](https://wpfui.lepo.co/)
* Trying out a new approach to MVVM using attributes
* Taking on a one-day project challenge
* Testing if ChatGPT could generate an appropriate logo

I'm really pleased with the outcome, and I hope you'll enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
